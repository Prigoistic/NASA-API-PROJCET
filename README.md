## Introduction

The Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) is a service provided by NASA that features a different image or photograph of our universe each day, along with a brief explanation written by a professional astronomer. This project aims to bring the beauty and wonder of the APOD to users through a clean and intuitive web interface.

- Allows users to view APODs from previous dates using a date picker.
- Handles different media types (images, videos).
- Responsive design for optimal viewing on various devices.
- Displays the APOD title and copyright information.
- Error handling for API requests.
- Loading states to provide user feedback during data fetching.
